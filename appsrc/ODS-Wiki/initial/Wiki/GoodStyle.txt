   * If you don't know how to format your text:
      * start each line without spaces
      * separate paragraphs with a blank line

   * You can produce better hypertext by using WikiWords (concatenated capitalized words):
      * WikiWords will be shown as hyperlinks
      * WikiWords are especially useful if they are meaningful and used uniformly across the whole site
      * The 'WikiWord' is WikiWord hyperlink by itself. Follow it to learn more :)

   * For *external site links*, you can type URLs directly into the text - =http://etcete.ra/...= - it'll clear to anyone where they're headed on click. 

   * If a *discussion* is going on:
      * separate each follow-up with a space
      * add your WikiName and the date at the end
      * OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
         * you may want to inset it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it's clear (always sign and date)
         * if a sub-topic develops, separate it with a horizontal rule at beginning and end

   * To start a new discussion:
      * start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
      * let the discussion begin

   * When a discussion is complete, boil down the key points:
      * reduce the noise
      * move offtopic facts to appropriate pages
      * if you merge or delete comments, group credit =Contributors:= at the end of the page

   * *Please*, avoid typing dates in national formats. Please use either an *standard date format* like 01 Sep 2001 or ISO (2001-09-01 or 2001-Sep-01).
   * *Please*, avoid words like 'next version' or 'year ago' whenever possible, even if it seems to you that the reader will know the context.
'Absolute' references are much better than 'relative'.
