The [[Virtuoso server]] provides a ready-to-use [[Wiki engine]] called "WikiV".
It keeps source texts in DAV collections, allowing users to edit them via DAV or
via any web browser. When a source text is changed, WikiV converts it into HTML
and a modified version is immediately available for all visitors of the website.
Unlike most of other Wiki engines, WikiV stores both source and compiled pages
not in separate files but in a database. Moreover, WikiV pre-process the page
when the page is changed, so the browsing of the resulting pages is made more
efficient then in the most of other engines.
As a result, WikiV provides good speed and scalability for large
corporate and Internet sites.

Two major syntaxes are supported:
   * [[TextFormattingRules][TWiki based oWiki dialect]] (default)
   * [[MediaWikiFormattingRules][MediaWiki based syntax]]
