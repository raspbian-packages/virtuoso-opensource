Dear %user%,

I have set up a %app% which is hosted at %service% and wish to share
it with you.

You may start using it by pointing your browser here: 
%app_action_url%. 
This invitation will expire in %timeout_join% hours. By registering as a user at %service% you 
can also create your own services, such as weblogs, wikis, file storage, et cetera, and share
them with your friends, if you wish. 

For more information, on all the services available at %service%, go here:
%service_url%.

Best wishes,

%app_owner%
