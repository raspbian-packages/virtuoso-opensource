This directory contains the source code for the maildrop.dll

Rebuilding it is a bit tricky.
In order to do that, you will need to have a recent Platform SDK online.

This is my environment setup script:

  @echo off

  set VC=F:\WINAPPS\VC98
  set SDK=E:\SDK

  set INCLUDE=%SDK%\INCLUDE;%VC%\INCLUDE;%VC%\MFC\INCLUDE;%VC%\ATL\INCLUDE
  set LIB=%SDK%\LIB;%VC%\LIB;%VC%\MFC\LIB;%VC%\ATL\LIB
  set Path=%systemroot%\system32;%systemroot%;%VC%\BIN

  set SDK=
  set VC=

First make sure your INCLUDE contains the SDK include directory before
the standard VC include directories.

Run the generate.bat from this directory. This will popule the ./gen
directory.

Then, enable the maildrop target in your project.prj, and run mkmk and nmake.
