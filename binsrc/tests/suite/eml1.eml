Ting,

Great.

Others: Please use this database to log bugs and new feature request
relating to Virtuoso. There are several new feature issues that need to go
into this DB ASAP. Patrick, please discuss this with Orri.

I await feedback clarifying that this system is accessible and that we all
know how to use it. Point your browsers to:
http://oplapp.openlink.co.uk/Development/Development.htm or
http://195.153.164.68/Development/Development.htm

Roys: Please ensure Yrjana (George 1) and George Kodinov have access to this
system.


Regards,
Kingsley
