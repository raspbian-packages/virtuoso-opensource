<para>
These statements are used to manage user accounts. Their use 
is limited to users with dba privileges, with the exception of SET PASSWORD.
</para>
<para>
CREATE USER makes a new user account. The password defaults to the user name.
DELETE USER deletes a user account. The account being dropped may not
have privileges granted to it nor can it be the user group of any user except itself.
SET USER GROUP assigns a group to a user.  By default a user belings to its own group. Changing 
a user&apos;s group to be another user causes the member user&apos;s effective privileges to be those of
the group plus those granted specifically to the member user.
</para>
<para>
Privileges are only inherited from the immediate group, not from the group&apos;s group
etc.
</para>
<para>
Note that the user names and passwords are identifiers. This means that they can 
be converted to upper case unless quoted in if the global CaseMode setting is 1.
</para>
