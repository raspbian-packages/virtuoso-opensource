This is not the original version of the benchmark.
The test data generator has changed by OpenLink Software: the file
/binsrc/tests/bsbm/src/benchmark/serializer/VirtSerializer.java
is added from scratch and invocation of related class is added to other files.
In case of problems related to that file, please contact OpenLink, not
authors of the original version.

The new code is licensed as a part of OpenLink Virtuoso Open Source Edition.
