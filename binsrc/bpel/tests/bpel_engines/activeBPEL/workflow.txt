  This tool is BPEL Moddeler which is using for creating the BPEL script with Eclipse and some ActiveBPEL plugins.
  IT creates the needed pdd file, but in more details this can be described after having an workflow experience with it.

Samples:
The AciveBPEL engine gives only one example for run:
suppose the root dir is activeBPEL. The sample is at 'C:\activeBPEL\samples\loan_approval'.
Additional info for running the sample can be found at: http://www.activebpel.org/docs/samples.html

After deploying the sample loan_approval,
the client url where the user can send message is: http://localhost:8080/bpel_example_client_page/index.jsp
The BpelAdmin url is: http://localhost:8080/BpelAdmin/. Here can be found the deployed process and instances with different states.
Also there is other addtional statistic info and configure options.

The type of file format is a little bit different from the format Oracle BPEL Manager for example uses - bpel-name.bpel, bpel-name.wsdl.
At the ActiveBpel there has to be created dir with name: bpel_process, and under it to be created subfolders: bpel, META-INF, wsdl where the
needed files has to be put.

If take the loan_approval sample, there is also 5 more folders:
-- classes, dist, jsp, src, web_services
Here has been put the needed files for running the client UI.

ActiveBpel do not have client UI for each process has been deployed, so this has to be written manually for each script.
