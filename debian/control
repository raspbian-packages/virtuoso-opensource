Description: high-performance database
 OpenLink Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database.
 It provides transactions, a smart SQL compiler, hot backup, SQL:1999
 support, a powerful stored-procedure language supporting server-side
 Java or .NET, and more. It supports all major data-access interfaces,
 including ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE/DB.
 .
 Virtuoso supports SPARQL embedded into SQL for querying RDF data stored
 in its database. SPARQL benefits from low-level support in the engine
 itself, such as SPARQL-aware type-casting rules and a dedicated IRI data
 type.
 .

 Virtuoso OSE ("Open-Source Edition").
